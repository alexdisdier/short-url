# Synopsis

This is an open source project to shorten urls. We will be using ReactJS for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end

## Usage example

See demo - 🚧

## ✅ Functionalities

- Enter an URL to shorten
- Display a list of all the shorten URLs already created by users
- Each shorten URL will be unique and a maximum length of 5 characters
- Display the number of visits each shorten URLs already have
- The shorten URL will redirect to the original page
- Each time a shorten URL is clicked, the counter for that URL will be incremented
- What if the url already has been shorten ??? do you create new one or warn the user it's already listed
